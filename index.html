  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: 11-26-2024</p>

  <p>The One Message app allows users to exchange messages anonymously, with all submitted messages made publicly available on the platform. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your data. Below, we outline how your information is handled when using the app.</p>

  <h2>1. Information Collected</h2>
  <p>One Message does not collect or store sensitive personal information or data that can uniquely identify users. The only data processed are the messages submitted by users, which are made publicly available on the platform for other users to view.</p>

  <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>
  <p>Messages submitted by users are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Published publicly on the platform;</li>
    <li>Made accessible to any user of the app.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No additional information, such as location, name, or interaction history, is collected.</p>

  <h2>3. Permissions Required</h2>
  <p>One Message only requests <strong>Internet access</strong> to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Allow the sending and receiving of public messages;</li>
    <li>Ensure connectivity with servers to display available messages.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Public Messages:</strong> All messages sent by users are shared publicly on the platform. It is the user's responsibility not to include personal or sensitive information in their messages.<br>
    <strong>Third Parties:</strong> No data is shared with third parties, as the app does not collect private or sensitive information.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Anonymity</h2>
  <p>
    - We do not request names, emails, phone numbers, or any other data that could identify a user.<br>
    - Each message is published anonymously and is not linked to any unique identity.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>
    While messages are public, we take technical measures to protect the platform's integrity and prevent misuse.<br>
    We strongly advise users not to share sensitive information, as all submitted messages are accessible to anyone using the app.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
